# openjscad-airfilter-mount
[OpenJSCad](http://openjscad.org/) code for a HEPA air filter mount exhaust port for a 3D printer enclosure. The fan is designed for a 120mm computer case fan. The [HEPA filters](http://www.amazon.com/Sears-KENMORE-Vacuum-86889-FILTERS/dp/B002D5JCXG) were some cheap smaller ones I found on Amazon that were somewhat close in size to a 120mm fan.

This is my first custom design for 3d printing so use with caution.
